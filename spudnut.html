    <p> Everyday when my grandmother <br>
        walked home from school in her <br>
        hometwon of El Dorado, Arkansas, <br>
        she would stop by the Spudnut <br>
        Shoppe with her friend Nancy. <br>
        
        
        Spudnuts are the potato based <br>
        donut that once dominated the <br>
        continental US. They are fluffy <br>
        and light donut shaped pastries <br>
        fried in crisco and coated with <br>
        a light glaze. <br>

    ------------------------------<br>


        Spudnut shops, a past American <br>
        staple rose to fame in the late <br>
        40's. There were over 300 spudnuts <br>
        stores across the country. But by <br>
        the late 60's the craze was over <br>
        and spudnut shops closed their <br>
        doors. Less than 30 remain today.<br>
